*0 Greetings, young farmer
*1 I assume that you are here to learn how to manage a farm sustainably :-)

$$0 Lucky for you I have a hat full of dandruff and wisdom

##0 Is there anything in particular you would like to know?

q00 How do I manage a farm?
a00 Oh that will take more than a few questions to get the hang of, but a good place to start is
a00 always remembering to water your crops after they have been sown, and giving your crops time to blossom.

q01 Why do I need to manage my farm properly?
a01 Otherwise the rooster will get ya.

q02 Why does my field-yield decrease after sowing the same crop several times?
a02 To keep the soil healthy you want to do a crop-rotation young one, it is simpler than it sounds.
a02 All you have to do is sow a different crop, so the soil has time to rejuvenate.

q03 Why can't I harvest my crops after watering?
a03 Why don't you come back after a nap and ask me again.
